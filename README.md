## Challenge 2: Speed Detector
-Challenge 2 Overview
The Speed Detector is a JavaScript application that measures and evaluates the speed of vehicles based on user input. This tool is designed to help users determine if a vehicle is speeding and can be used in various scenarios, such as driving education and traffic monitoring.

-Features
Input vehicle speed and speed limit
Instant feedback on whether the vehicle is speeding
User-friendly interface for easy interaction
Display of speeding violation messages

-Speed Evaluation Logic
The application uses a simple logic to determine if a vehicle is speeding:

If the vehicle's speed is greater than the speed limit, it is considered speeding.
If the vehicle's speed is less than or equal to the speed limit, it is within the limit.

-Acknowledgments
Developed to address the need for a simple speed detection tool.
Special thanks to mentors and peers for their support and feedback during development.

## Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
-Challenge 3 Overview
The Net Salary Calculator is a JavaScript application designed to help users calculate their net salary after tax deductions. This tool is useful for employees and freelancers alike, allowing them to better understand their take-home pay based on various income and deduction parameters.

Output:
Net Salary: $4,000

-Solutions
Salary Calculation Logic
The application uses the following formula to calculate net salary:

Net Salary = Gross Salary - (Gross Salary * Tax Rate)

-Acknowledgments
Developed to assist individuals in understanding their net income.
Special thanks to colleagues and mentors for their guidance and support during the development process.
